Cozee Coffee

In Project Part 1, you will create a program for a type of small businesses. The program should incorporate all required elements as listed and described in Chapters 1 â€“ 9. This program is intended to improve business process and operation flow. 

For this project, I have created a program intended for a small local coffeeshop. My program is designed for the use of customers. They will be able to pay virtually without person to person contact. This will minimize waiting lines, an overcrowding shop, and reduce the workload on baristas. The program is designed to display the menu and the customers can choose any of the available options. 

First, my program displays Cozee's menu. The menu is formatted with an order number next its corresponding menu choice. Then, the program asks the customer for the number of items they will order. The user inputs the number of items, and afterward, the program will ask for their order number. The user will input their order number one at a time. Once they are done with their order then they will press the number 0 to indicate the end of their order. Lastly, the program will display the receipt of their order, which contains the subtotal, sales tax, and total.
